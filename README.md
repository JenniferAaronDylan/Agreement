## Description of the project


* What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
Jennifer: Jennifer’s overall strength is designing the structure of the website, so CSS/HTML.
Dylan: Dylan’s overall strength is the person we can rely on to help with pair programming and for collaboration. In addition, to overall process of trying to complete the tasks.
Aaron: Aaron’s overall strength is in project management, and javascript programming in general. 
* How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
Jennifer: I can help with overall design of the project and the wireframe portion for the project. And anything involving CSS.
Aaron: Aaron can help coordinate and run the project. In addition, and help write and review the javascript functionality for the app.
Dylan: Dylan can help with the general javascript coding for the project.
* In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
Jennifer: I would like to get better at knowing how to structure javascript code and just get better with the fundamentals. Get better at pair programming as well.
Aaron: Aaron would like to improve his teamwork skills, as well as his collaboration skills.
Dylan: Dylan would like to get better knowledge in constructors and prototype. 
* Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
We would propose that we divide the task to each person, where we work independently. But, we would be able to rely on each other if need be on Remo.We would also do Merge-Reviews, basically, we would explain our code before merging our code into Github.
* What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
We propose that any conflicts that arise will be involved between those involved. If the conflict escalates, then the whole group will talk-it-out. 
* What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
We propose that we would just vocalize our concerns if one person is taking over the project. In addition, when we assign our individual tasks, the person in charge of the project will have the majority of say. Unless that help is requested by that person. This will allow each person to have some autonomy over their own project. 
* How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
Have some empathy for your teammates. We all agree that our ultimate goal is to complete the project as a team, thus teamwork and working as a unit will be our main goal.
* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
We would propose that each day we’ll review each other and our project. Thus, having open communication with each other. If they are behind we can help them reach the goals for each day. Plus, we’ll try to find out if there is a reason for the lack of contributions.
* How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
We propose that after attempts to try to resolve the issues ourselves, we would request help from our instructor Audrey. 
* What hours will you be available to communicate?
We all agree to work during class hours, so 9am to 6pm PST.
* What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
Slack and Remo
* How often will you take breaks?
As many as we need. No set break time.
* What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
We all agree to rely on each other if one person starts to fall behind.
* How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
There is no expectation for anyone to respond after class hours. Depends on the person and urgency.
* What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
Conscious turn-taking when we communicate. Being mindful of others when they’re talking.
* How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
We agree that our ultimate goal is finishing the project and to work cohesively. We are not expecting perfection, so no negative-type communication is not-allowed. We will police each other and make sure that any feedback given is positive.  
* How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
We will post on our group slack channel of any assignments/tasks that need to be done. We will also use Github-projects to help us keep track of any assignments we need to complete.
* What project management tool will be used?
We will be using Github projects for our project management tool.




* What components of your project will live on GitHub?
The components of our project that will live on Github will be the overall project. Such, as all files, code, and our Git-hub project management tool.
* How will you share the repository with your teammates?
The repository will be shared through our organization.
* What is your Git flow?
We agree that each individual who’s responsible for a certain portion will be able to commit to their own branch. But for staging, we’re not going to have a set time, if someone needs to stage something to complete their task, just let the others in our team know. But if it is a major application for the website, we all agree to review the code before merging to main. We will merge max once a day (end of day). 
* Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
   * How many people must review a PR?
      * The full team for major pull requests and 1 for a minor update or for staging. 
   * Who merges PRs?
      * Anyone except for the creator of the pull request.
   * How often will you merge?
      * We agree to merge once a day for main, but no set schedule for staging, but we all need to be aware before staging.
   * How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
      * We will agree that we will merge at the end
